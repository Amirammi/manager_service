<h1>Task Management System</h1>
  <p>Here you can see my own implementation of the website, that can help you and your team organize work!</p>
  
  <p>I tried to make it simple and in the same time comfortable for use. You can create user and team, build your own task board, assign people to different tasks. There are tags, which help you find similar tasks faster and buttons to switch between projects.</p>
  
  New feature implemented:
- SignUp button added to the login page
- Tag buttons added to the task-board page
- Buttons to switch projects added to the task-board page
- "Add me" button added to the task-detail page
- At the edit & create task page assignees are filtered (only members of the team)
- Add button "Delete team from a project" at the team-detail page (team's projects table) 
- Add button "Add/remove user to/from a team" at the users pages
- Add button "Assign my team/Remove my team" to a project detail page
